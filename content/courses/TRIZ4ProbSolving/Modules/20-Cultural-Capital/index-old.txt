## Introduction

We will understand Pierre Bourdieu's Concept of Cultural Capital(CC).

CC affects our view of the world and helps us identify Problem
Situations and Contradictions in Life.

1.  **What is Cultural Capital?**

2.  Cultural Capital <br> {{< youtube 5DBEYiBkgp8 >}}

## Activities

### Sharing

1.  Sharing of CC: we will each of us take turns to reveal some aspect
    of Cultural Capital that we directly possess: **Objectified**,
    **Institutional**, and **Embodied**

-   What is something that replicates from generation to generation,
    biologically?
-   Is there something that replicates "non-biologically"?
-   How would you measure that? In what units, so to speak?

### Re-Inventing your Own Game

1.  You will be divided into Teams. Each Team needs to chose a wellknown
    parlour/household or board game from your childhood. Set it up and
    play it.
2.  Then, you will be given a piece of Electronic Hardware called a
    **Makey-Makey**. You will need to include this hardware in your Game
    and extend the Game in a certain way.

## TRIZ Concept: Su-Field Analysis

We will later tie this activity to the TRIZ idea of *Substance-Field
Analysis*. Perhaps you have a premonitory idea about this already?

2.  Here are some instructions:\

-   Visit your home town on Google Maps
-   Select a specific STREET INTERSECTION there.
-   Copy paste the Shape of the Street Intersection into your favourite
    image making software
-   Create A LOGO for your city, using the Shape, such that you show off
    some interesting aspects of your City, based on your own CULTURAL
    CAPITAL.
-   Three sentences to describe your Logo.
-   See examples at the link above for inspiration

## Serendipity

This course is about nothing if not about *serendipity*.
<https://www.dictionary.com/browse/serendipity>. We will connect this
logo building idea with the idea of Metaphors in TRIZ.
