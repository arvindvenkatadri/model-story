## Introduction

Socrates said, "Gnothi seauton"(Γνῶθι σαυτόν), *know thyself*. Let us do that, as we create some novel situations for ourselves in a Game.

### Icebreaker Game!

Look at the slide full of numbers on the screen. I would like you to:

-   *Silently* work through the slide until you have found all the numbers\
-   Raise your hand when you have done so.

### A Personality Game

I have divided you up into 4 groups. Each group will be given a specific task. You will need to:

-   Discuss how to complete the Task\
-   Complete the Task and document your work\
-   *Also* document the main aspects of Discussion in your group. Who said/ suggested what; what were the points of agreement; what were the contentious points etc.\
-   Present all of this : 7 + 5 minutes / team

## Why does this Matter to Us

From the two exercises, we see that:\
- reality really matters upon the viewer: and that there are many possible points of view.\
- We all have our "default modes" for behaviour\
- As creators we need to be able straddle, if possible, the spectrum of the 4 preference pairs, in order to comprehend reality better.
