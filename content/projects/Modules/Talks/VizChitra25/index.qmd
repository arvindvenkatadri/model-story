## The Orange Visual Interface

Let us create some simple visualizations using Orange.

-   Use the `File Widget` to import the `iris` dataset into your session
-   Use the `Data Table Widget` to look at the data, and note its
    variable names
-   Use the `Visualization Widgets` ( Scatter Plot, Bar Plot, and
    Distributions) to look at the properties of the variables, and
    examine relationships between them.

What was Brad Pitt throwing away? He was throwing away the individuality
of the measures, subsuming them to one summary. This is a big idea in
statistics, and it is called aggregation.

Steven Stigler (2016) in “The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom”:

-   One of the Big Ideas in Statistics is: ***Aggregation***
-   How is it revolutionary?
-   By stipulating that, given a number of observations, [you can
    actually gain information by throwing information
    away]{.bg-light-red .black}
-   In taking a simple arithmetic mean, we discard the individuality of
    the measures, subsuming them to one summary.

{{< iconify tabler ruler-measure size=3x >}}
{{< iconify lucide square-sigma size=3x >}}</center>

Before we plot a single chart, it is wise to take a look at several
numbers that summarize the dataset under consideration. What might these
be? Some obviously useful numbers are:

-   Dataset length: How many rows/observations?
-   Dataset breadth: How many columns/variables?
-   How many Quant variables?
-   How many Qual variables?
-   Quant variables: min, max, mean, median, sd
-   Qual variables: levels, counts per level
-   Both: means, medians for each level of a Qual variable...

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why? {.smaller}

::::: columns

-   **To summarize is to understand**.
-   Add to that the fact that our [Working Memories can hold maybe 7
    items](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two),
    so it means information retention too.
-   Borges wrote, “To think is to **forget details, generalize, make
    abstractions**. In the teeming world of [“Funes the
    Memorious,”](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Borges_FunesTheMemorious.pdf),
    there were only details.”
-   Brad Pitt aka Billy Beane was throwing away the details, and looking
    at the **aggregated** picture to pick his future Oakland A's team.

## What Charts work for counting? {.smaller}

| Variable #1 | Variable #2 | Chart Names |              Chart Shape              |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:-----------------------------:|
|    Qual     |    None     |  Bar Chart  | {{< iconify ion bar-chart size=4x >}} |

-   Bar charts are used to show "counts" and "tallies" with respect to
    Qual variables.
-   For instance, in a survey, how many people vs Gender?
-   In a Target Audience survey on *Weekly Consumption*, how many low,
    medium, or high expenditure people?
-   NOTE: we count with Qual variables! (Why? We count labels, like
    letters.)
-   Which is why the Bars are not touching each other.

:::::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

-   Counts first give you **an absolute sense of how much data you
    have**.
-   Counts by different Qual variables give you a sense of the
    **combinations** you have in your data:
    $(State) * (District) * (Ban)$
-   Counts then give an idea whether your data is lop-sided
-   Since the X-axis in bar charts is *Qualitative* (the bars don't
    touch, remember!) it is possible to sort the bars at will.

None.

### Qualitative Data

-   `survived`: (chr) yes or no
-   `status`: (chr) Class of Travel, else "crew"
-   `age`: (chr) Adult, Child
-   `sex`: (chr) Male / Female.

## {{< iconify tabler variable >}} What kind of Data Variables will we choose?

| Variable #1 | Variable #2 | Chart Names | Chart Shape |
|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| Qual | Qual | ~~Pies~~, Mosaic Charts | {{< iconify carbon chart-marimekko size=4x >}} |

Here, $area \sim count$, so the area of the tile is proportional to the
count of observations in that tile.

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Question #1 {.smaller}

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="45%"}
::: callout-note
What is the dependence of `survived` upon `sex`?
:::

![](../../../../materials/images/Orange/titanic-sex-survived.png)
::::

:::: {.column width="45%"}
::: callout-note
-   Note the huge imbalance in `survived` with `sex`
-   Men have clearly perished in larger numbers than women.
-   Colouring shows large [*positive* residuals]{style="color: blue;"}
    for men who died, and large [*negative*
    residuals]{style="color: red;"} for women who died.

So sadly Jack is far more likely to have died than Rose.

### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Question #2 {.smaller}

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="45%"}

### How does `survived` depend upon `status`?
:::

![](../../../../materials/images/Orange/titanic-mosaic-survived-status.png)
::::

:::: {.column width="45%"}
::: callout-note
-   Crew has seen deaths in large numbers,
    -   as seen by the large [*negative* residual]{style="color: red;"}
        for crew-survivals.
-   [First Class passengers have had speedy access to the
    boats](https://youtu.be/kQ8WsD9AGX4) and have survived in larger
    proportions than say second or third class.
-   There is a large [*positive* residual]{style="color: blue;"} for
    first-class survivals.
-   Rose travelled `first class` and Jack was `third class`. So again
    the odds are stacked against him.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What are these Residuals anyhow? {.smaller}

When differences between the actual and expected counts are large, we
deduce that one Qual variable has an effect on the other Qual variable.
(speaking counts-wise or ratio-wise)

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| fig-height: 12
#| fig-subcap: 
#|  - "Actual Counts"
#|  - "Expected Counts!!"
#|  - "Tile-Wise Differences = Residuals"
data("titanic", package = "ggmosaic")

counts_table <- mosaic::tally(Survived ~ Sex, data = titanic) # No margins added
vcd::mosaic(counts_table,gp = shading_max, 
            main = "Titanic Mosaic Chart")
vcd::mosaic(counts_table, gp = shading_max, type = "expected", main = "Titanic Mosaic Chart, Expected")
vcd::assoc(counts_table, gp = shading_max)

```

---

## Wait, But Why?
-   Mosaic Charts are used to show the relationship between two Qual
    variables.
-   They show the counts of observations in each combination of the two
    Qual variables.
-   The area of each tile is proportional to the count of observations in that tile
-  The colour of the tile shows the residuals, which are the differences
    between the actual and expected counts.

## The Art of Surprise with Gabbar Singh{.smaller}

And Gabbar's Hypothesis?

-   That three bullets would never line up just ready to be fired,
    especially after he had fired three off!!
-   So he could claim "ignorance"!
-   "Ignorance" == "Fairness" == "Justice" !
-   But he was ***pretend-surprised*** when the three bullets were lined up, and he
    could fire them all off at once!
-   But no one could accuse him of anything, because he was "ignorant"
    of the fact that the bullets were lined up!

### [Are Emily and Greg more Employable than Lakisha and Jamal?](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/AER/ResumeNames.html)

Is ethnicity (as revealed by first names) a basis for racial
discrimination, in the US?

This dataset was generated as part of a landmark research study done by
[Marianne Bertrand and Senthil
Mullainathan](https://sci-hub.se/10.1257/0002828042002561).

Read the description therein to really understand how you can ***prove
causality*** with a well-crafted research experiment.

  select(name, ethnicity, call) %>% 
  mutate(call = factor(call,labels = c("yes", "no"), levels = c("yes", "no")))
head(resumes, 6)

resumes %>% group_by(ethnicity) %>% count(call)

resumes %>% group_by(ethnicity) %>% summarise(call_prop = prop(call) * 100)

diffprop(ethnicity ~ call, data = resumes)

-   So it appears the call percentage is different for the two
    ethnicities, `afam` and `cauc`
-   But is it statistically significant? Would Gabbar be surprised?
-   Let us pretend `ethnicity` ***does not matter*** and spin the
    revolver!!
-   We mess with the ethnicity variable, some 5000 times

- We are not able to ***mimic Mother Nature aka Reality***{{< iconify fluent-emoji-flat:weary-cat >}}
- The red line is the observed difference in proportions, and it is
  way out of the null distribution.
- So we can reject the NULL Hypothesis that `ethnicity` does not
  matter.
- Hence we infer that there was bias in the hiring process, and
  that `afam` candidates were discriminated against.
