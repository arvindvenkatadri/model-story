(I will put up her books, \"Ethnomathematics\" and \"Math\nElsewhere\" on a separate folder on BB.)\n\n2)  Saty Raghavachary: Tile-based Kolam Patterns\n\nThis is an alternative way, of using permutations of simple \"Tiles\" that\ncan be used to alphabetically form a Kolam. ( This is also briefly\ntouched upon in MArcia Ascher's paper).\n\nSaty Raghavachary is Professor of Computer Science at U of Southern\nCalifornia.\n\nAlso take a look a the 2 minute video on kolam at his website:\nhttps://satysfactory.blogspot.in/2009/01/kolams.html\n\n### Symmetry\n\nW5 - D1 - Thomas Edward Brown and Elizabeth Barrett Browning 1) Thomas\nEdward Brown\n\nhttps://www.thewayofbeauty.org/blog/2012/09/a-garden-is-a-lovesome-thing-god-wot\n\nif you have heard of the word \"godwottery\", it came from this poem.\n\n2)  Elizabeth Barrett Browning\n\nhttps://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/how-do-i-love-thee-sonnet-43\n\nhttps://mathstat.slu.edu/escher/index.php/Introduction_to_Symmetry\n",
