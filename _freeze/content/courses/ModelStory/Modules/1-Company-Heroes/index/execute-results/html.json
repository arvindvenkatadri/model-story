Why is the Human Species\ndifferent from all others? Those two questions are not unrelated !!\n\nThe Human Species is perhaps unique in that we are able to <u>[cooperate\nwith strangers](https://fee.org/media/4316/547_42.pdf)</u>!! Yes! Do you\nthink that designing things, building and conducting a business, or\nmaking art is something like that? No? Well, let us see a few quick\nstories!!\n\n## Story-1\n\n### Do you know who these four people are ?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Dartagnan-musketeers.jpg/512px-Dartagnan-musketeers.jpg){width=350px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The Hero's Journey\n\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m34!1m12!1m3!1d5619597.823074568!2d2.755529685345978!3d46.54878964634841!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m19!3e1!4m5!1s0x12a9d38abcf194c3%3A0x47bfee34eecc4749!2sTarbes%2C%20France!3m2!1d43.232951!2d0.078082!4m5!1s0x47e4eca0d3e2cca1%3A0x26a31399ffc66f20!2sMeung-sur-Loire%2C%2045130%2C%20France!3m2!1d47.827006999999995!2d1.6974319999999998!4m5!1s0x47e66e1f06e2b70f%3A0x40b82c3688c9460!2sParis%2C%20France!3m2!1d48.856614!2d2.3522219!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1639201450428!5m2!1sen!2sin\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" style=\"border:0;\" allowfullscreen loading=\"lazy\">\n\n</iframe>\n\nThis is the story of a young man who leaves home from Tarbes, in\nGascony, France, to travel to Paris to make his fortune. He has two\nblessings,one each from his mother and his father. True to the\ninstructions given by his Dad, and his very Gascon nature, <u>[he picks\na fight even before he reaches Paris.](https://youtu.be/KXvzAvOL5GI)</u>\n\n### Classic Movie Time!\n\nLet us watch a (very very) small part of this movie, <u>[The Three\n~~Pangas~~\nMusketeers-1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers_(1973_live-action_film))</u>.\nHere is the <u>[IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072281/)</u>\nfor film buffs.\n\n<u><https://www.tcm.com/video/454255/three-musketeers-the-1973-movie-clip-we-are-only-three/></u>\n\nand this order version:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WRR0k2-8i-I\" title=\"The Three Musketeers(1935) - D&#39;Artagnan vs. Athos vs. Cardinal Guards\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen>\n\n</iframe>\n\n### Classic Fiction Time!\n\nLet us read aloud(!) a bit of good old classic fiction !! This is the\nConversation that occurs right before the duel scene we saw in the video\nabove.\n\n<u>[**Chapter 5. THE KING'S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINAL'S\nGUARDS**](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1257/1257-h/1257-h.htm).</u>[^1]\nKeep an eye on the conversation! And an ear open for French-ified\nEnglish, I beseech you!!\n\nHere is the audio reading of this chapter from\n<u>[Librivox.org](https://librivox.org/the-three-musketeers-by-alexandre-dumas/)</u>\n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<audio controls> <source src='three_musketeers_05_dumas.mp3' type='audio/mpeg'> Your browser does not support the audio tag;  for browser support, please see:  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp </audio>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n\n### Discussion-1\n\n-   <u>[\"When have to shoot, shoot! Don't\n    talk!\"](https://youtu.be/JrYtD7gSWsI?feature=shared)</u> said\n    <u>[Eli Wallach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Wallach)</u>.\n-   Pardon,m'sieu, but why were they so polite to each other? (Oh, These\n    French...)\n-   Were they talking as if they didn't want to fight?\n-   But to \"have fought already\"?\n-   The **Shadow of the Future**\n\n## Story-2\n\nWhat about this game ?\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://criticalcommons.org/embed?m=vufgXphCO\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>\n\n</iframe>\n\n### Discussion-2\n\nWhat **emotions** or **motivations** are portrayed by the characters in\nthe story? We can think of the \"4Rs\":\n\n-   Reward\n-   Regret aka FOMO\n-   Risk\n-   Retribution/Punishment\n\n### Nice Guys Finish First\n\n{{< video https://youtube.com/watch?v=rr6lsTgZKAQ >}}\n\n\n## <u>[Wait, But Why?](https://waitbutwhy.com)</u>\n\n-   Many public behaviours require us to *trust* strangers\n-   We have Rule of Law based on this trust\n-   If there is no **C** at first, then everybody does a **D**\n-   That is the source of the **Dilemma**\n-   As Artists and Designers, and Creators, we need to practice our\n    craft that in such a way as to induce *niceness*...\n-   So what will you make? A movie? An ad? A public sign-board? A street\n    play? An illustration? A \"spatial arrangement\"? A policy or a law?\n\n## References\n\n1.  John D.
