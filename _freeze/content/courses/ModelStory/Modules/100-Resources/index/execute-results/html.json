The understanding of each\nHuman Experience is intended to lead to a Model, in the manner of\nCharlie Munger and Scott E. Page. The Human Experience + Model will be,\nin each case, motivated by contemplating a well known Story, or a Drama,\nand a Painting. The Models may resemble a Thought Experiment, or a\nDiagram, or a simple Procedure or Math Formula, or a piece of Computer\nCode. The Models are intended to provide directions for artistic and\ndesign endeavours.\n\nThe Models will be understood, internalized, fitted in with what we\nalready know, and generalized to new applications. This will done with\nthe help of activities based on games, videos, art-related activities,\nopen source software tools, field experiments, field visits, additional\nreadings, writings and discussions.\n\n## Complexity\n\n**Other Terms:**\n`Emergence /  Coherence / Aggregation / Unison / Self Organization`\n\n-   Mitchell Resnick: <u>[Beyond the Centralized\n    Mindset](https://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/decentralized/)</u>\n-   Steven Johnson: \"Emergence\": Chapter..TBD\\\n-   Motivate \"individual, simple rules\" that lead to \"emergence of\n    patterns\" as a central idea\\\n-   Motivate Philip Anderson's idea \"More is Different\"\n    <u>[PDF](https://www.tkm.kit.edu/downloads/TKM1_2011_more_is_different_PWA.pdf)</u>\n-   Simple and not so simple Phenomena\n    -   Mexican Wave and Clapping Patterns\\\n    -   Arpita Baypeyi’s Idea: \"Repetitive Patterns in Dance - Kathak\"\\\n    -   Kannada Proverb \"Gumpinalli Govinda\"\\\n    -   Douglas Hofstadter, \"Ant Fugue\" in his 1979 book\\\n    -   Use the \"Rain\" video ( though that does have Central\n        Control...).

Viewers must use dance and/or gestures holding\nhandphones, to create music together . **Each user must be able to\ncontrol unique aspects of the music** to create a collaborative piece\neach time. There must be clear opportunities and instructions for\ncollaboration based on a **Stag Hunt / Coordination Game**. **Tools:**\n`Software: Pure Data for sound synthesis; Android apps like Sensors2OSC for sensor data logging and sharing over WiFi`\n`Hardware: WiFi network hotspot; Smartphones; Laptop or Raspberry Pi running PureData`\\\n**Ideas from our Course:**\n`Proximity; Game Theory / Stag Hunt; Networks and Graphs`\\\n**Resources:**\n\n-   <u>[PureData Sound Synthesizer](puredata.info)</u>\\\n-   <u>[Sensors2OSC](https://sensors2.org/osc/)</u>\\\n\n### Project 2: <u>Living on the Ceiling</u>\n\n**Task:** Use physical movement in the room along with smartphone sensor\ndata to project a live Voronoi Diagram on the ceiling. (Hat tip to Anuja\nGaikwad, FSP 2019-2020)\n\n**Tools:**\n`Software: Processing; Android apps for sensor data logging and sharing over WiFi`\n\\`Hardware: WiFi network hotspot; Smartphones; Arduino + Wi-Fi;\nMakey-Makey'\n\n**Ideas from our Course:** `Proximity; Schelling Points`\n\n**Resources:**.\n\n-   <u>[Processing](https://processing.org/)</u>\\\n-   <u>[Mesh Library for Processing](http://leebyron.com/mesh/)</u>\\\n-   <u>[How to make things with\n    Make-Makey](https://makeymakey.com/pages/how-to)</u>\\\n\n### Project 3: <u>Nightmare at Room 307</u>\n\n**Task:** Create strange bloodcurdling sounds based on where individuals\nare standing in the room. Participants need to move, perhaps be\nblindfolded and wear headphones / earphones.\n\n**Tools:**\n`Software: Geogebra or R/RStudio; Android apps for sensor data logging and sharing over WiFi`\n`Hardware: WiFi network hotspot; Smartphones; Arduino with Wifi; Makey-Makey for position location based on footfall`\n\n**Ideas from our Course:** `Proximity; Schelling Points`\n\n**Resources:**\n\n-   <u>[Theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin)</u>\n\n### Project 4: Friends (Season 65, Episode 12)\n\n**Task:** Use this article in the Atlantic Magazine as inspiration: [How\nfriendships in\nAdulthood](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/how-friendships-change-over-time-in-adulthood/411466/).\nCreate a physical graph/network related installation, based on personal,\nor crowd-sourced, or fictitious but plausible friendship data, and show\nin an interactive way how these friendship networks change over time.\nUse our collected college network data, and inspiration from\n<https://graphcommons.com> as a starting point. Can embed electronic\n(lights) or computed elements ( touch ) , if desired from an aesthetic\npoint of view or to create/enhance Viewer participation. The\ninstallation should show small changes over “time” and must be\n**wilfully and meaningfully degradable by viewers**. Water, ink, knives,\nor flame, rubber-bands and oil are possibilities. No acid.\n\n**Tools:**\n`Software: None specified. graphcommons.com and RStudio are possibilities. Arduino can also be used for embedding computational elements.`\n`Hardware: None specified. NO THERMOCOL.`\n\n**Ideas from our Course:**\n`Networks and Graphs; Connectors and Hubs; Network Dynamics and Measures; Erdos-Renyi / Watts-Strogatz / Barabasi-Albert models; Power Laws`\n\n#### Project 5: Six Degrees of Separation\n\n**Task:** Read the Skit/Play , [“Six Degrees of\nSeparation”](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/72632/six-degrees-of-separation-by-john-guare/)\nby John Guare. Stage or show in some way, part or all of it.\n\n**Tools:** `Software: None specified`\n`Hardware: None specified.
