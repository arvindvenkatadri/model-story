Is our data clean? Do we have two columns of data,\none containing 60counts of vehicles, and the other containing\ninter-vehicular gap times in seconds?\\\nWe will use a tool called, ah...umm...ahem...er...**WTFcsv**. Let us\nfirst quickly see what this tool offers us!\n\n{{< vimeo 150216437 >}}\n\nLet us import our data into the <u>[**WTFcsv**\ntool](https://databasic.io/en/wtfcsv/)</u> and see what patterns lurk\nbeneath our data!\n\n### Discussion-1\n\n-   There were similar patterns in everybody's data\n    ðŸ˜®\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   What we saw was an example of the **Poisson Arrival Process**.\n-   This has applications in *Service Design*, *Traffic Management*,\n    *Logistics*, *Finding Defects in Materials*, *Weather Modelling*,\n    *Pest Control*...\n\nFrom <u><https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/297375></u>:\n\n> (Say) Lambda($\\lambda$) is the *average number* of cars that pass per\n> unit of time, let's say 60/hour ($\\lambda$ = 60). We know, however,\n> that the actual number will vary - some days more, some days less. The\n> **Poisson Distribution** allows us to *model this variability*.\n>\n> Now, an average of 60 cars per hour equates to an average of 1 car\n> passing by each minute. Again though, we know there's going to be\n> variability in the amount of time between arrivals: Sometimes more\n> than 1 minute; other times less. The **Exponential Distribution**\n> allows us to *model this variability*.\n>\n> All that being said, cars passing by on a road won't always follow a\n> Poisson Process. If there's a traffic signal just around the corner,\n> for example, arrivals are going to be bunched up instead of steady. On\n> an open highway, a slow tractor-trailer may hold up a long line of\n> cars, again causing bunching. In these cases, the Poisson Distribution\n> may still work okay for longer time periods, but the exponential will\n> fail badly in modeling arrival times.\n>\n> Note also that there is huge variability based on **time of day**:\n> busier during commuting times; much slower at 3am. Make sure that your\n> lambda is reflective of the specific time period you are considering.\n\nLambda then becomes a **parameter** of the model. And the higher the\n$\\lambda$, the more the traffic. Hence shorter the *average\ninter-vehicular gap time*, which is $\\Large{\\sim \\frac{1}{\\lambda}}$.\n\n-   So everything random is not really random?\n-   Is *anything* random at all?\n-   Does seeing a pattern make it \"not random\"?\n-   Are we just Victims of Randomness and cannot do much else but put up\n    with it?\n\n## Poisson Distribution as a 4As Complexity Idea...\n\nConsider a coin toss. One gets HEAD(H) or TAIL(T), and if the coin is\nfair, the long term chances of getting a H or a T are even. If one\ntosses a single coin several times, one gets different sequences of Hs\nand Ts.\n\nIf we assume that an H means people <u>[**get into their car and\ndrive**](https://youtu.be/w9NbXDXvr8M)</u>, what can we say of many many\npeople? They are all tossing coins, so to speak, and leave only if they\nget a H. *Each sequence of Hs and Ts is a manifestation of car traffic*,\nwith H being a vehicle, and T being no vehicle.\n\nIn a large society with $\\large{n~ -> \\infty}$, not many people drive\nout at any given time, so $p$ is low. So the product\n$\\large{people \\times p(H) = np}$ can be thought of as a constant, say\n10, or 100.\n\nThe Accumulated random binary Actions of a large number of people gives\nus an aggregate <u>[**Poisson\ndistribution**](https://math.oxford.emory.edu/site/math117/connectingPoissonAndBinomial/)</u>\nfor the occurrence of traffic, with a mean of $\\large{\\lambda = np}$.\n\n## Is Randomness a Design Tool?\n\n![](pexels-sharath-g-4418675.jpg){height=\"250px\"}\n\nBut we are interested in more than just the Poisson Process. And mangoes\nare far more interesting than cars!!!\n\n1.  Do you remember plucking mangoes from the trees in your childhood\n    gardens?\n2.  Did you happen to be the youngest in the group?\n3.  Did you have run home to get the salt + chilly powder?\n4.  Why did you trust your friends not to eat off the best mangoes in\n    your absence? ;-D\n5.  Were you used to being the \"*denner*\" in every game?\n6.  Or the last person to bat or bowl, or whatever was the cool thing in\n    the game...\n7.  Or did you do that \"bat numbers\" thing?\n8.  Why did you trust your friends? ;-D\n9.  What strategy did you use when playing \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\"? Were\n    you always \"steady as a rock\", or \"variable as traffic\"?\n\nPerhaps you suffered, but maybe you didn't because everyone \"got their\nturn\" and they weren't always the first, nor were you always the last...\nSo somehow it was all...fair, because it was \"random\".\n\nAnd you didn't stick with just one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors. But\nchose one at.....random.\n\nSo can we use **Randomness** in Design? With *intent*? And is\n<u>[this](https://www.jacksonpollock.org)</u> the use of **randomness**\nin Art?\n\n### Pedagogical Vandalism\n\nLet us throw some chalk pieces on the floor at random and see what\nhappens!!\n\n1.  Was that a completely \"mad\" thing to do, throwing stuff on the\n    floor? Or was it an act of ***Pedagogical Vandalism***? (See\n    <u>[*wreck this\n    Journal*](https://youtu.be/OCTaIZc1o8g?si=o7Bhi437vFZppXJQ)</u>).\n\n2.  Is Randomness just too much to handle or comprehend?\n\n3.  Or can we \"tame\" it in some way, and put it to use in Art, Design,\n    and Tech?\n\n4.  Have we been doing this all along? Have we been <u>[*holding\n    infinity in the palm of our\n    hands*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43650/auguries-of-innocence)</u>,\n    in the à¤¹à¤¾à¤¥ à¤•à¥€à¥‡ à¤²à¤•à¥€à¤°à¥‡?\n\n5.  What **diagrams or thought experiments** can we create to do this?\n\n6.  WHY would this be a good idea? Is there a very **Human Motivation**\n    behind this desire we might have?\n\n7.  Or let's ask <u>[this\n    lady](https://wyldnetworks.com/blog/hedy-lamarr-frequency-hopping-spread-spectrum)</u>\n    here.\n\n![Hedy\nLamarr](Hedy-Lamarr-and-the-Frequency-Hopping-Spread-Spectrum.jpg)\n\n## <u>[Wait, But Why?](https://waitbutwhy.com)</u>\n\n-   Randomness can help create fairness?\n-   Visibly?\n-   *Generate Randomness* to make things fair? How?\n-   What does that even mean, to <u>[\"generate\n    randomness\"](https://www.random.org/coins/)</u>?\n-   If something is random-random, how can it be fair \"every time\"?\n-   What does <u>[**\"every\n    time\"**](https://web.archive.org/web/20190302202830id_/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a931/ac1b3ef11235d4516f341b3b5bd8b1ee330e.pdf)</u>\n    even mean?\n-   Whom would you meet in a casino? In other words, what if something\n    looks random, but isn't really? See Reference 2 below.\n\nWe'll see.\n\n### References\n\n1.
