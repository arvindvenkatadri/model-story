There is a direct   |\n|                           | opposition – to be, or not to be. Hamlet |\n|                           | is thinking about life and death and     |\n|                           | pondering a state of being versus a      |\n|                           | state of not being – being alive and     |\n|                           | being dead.                              |\n+---------------------------+------------------------------------------+\n| Whether ’tis nobler in    | The balance continues with a             |\n| the mind to suffer\\       | consideration of the way one deals with  |\n| *The slings and arrows of | life and death. Life is a lack of power: |\n| outrageous fortune*,\\     | the living are at the mercy of *the      |\n| Or to take arms against a | blows of outrageous fortune*. Should we  |\n| *sea of troubles*,\\       | *nobly suffer* or should we *take arms   |\n| And by opposing end them? | and fight* against these random things?  |\n+---------------------------+------------------------------------------+\n| To die: to sleep;\\        | The only action one can take against the |\n| No more; and by a sleep   | things he lists among those blows is to  |\n| to say we end\\            | end one’s life.                          |\n| The heart-ache and the    |                                          |\n| *thousand natural         | That’s the only way of opposing them.    |\n| shocks*\\                  | The ‘sleep of death’ is therefore        |\n| That flesh is heir to,    | empowering: killing oneself is a way of  |\n| ’tis a consummation\\      | taking action, taking up arms, opposing  |\n| Devoutly to be wish’d.    | and defeating the slings and arrows of   |\n|                           | outrageous fortune. Living is a passive  |\n|                           | state; dying is an active state.         |\n+---------------------------+------------------------------------------+\n| To die, to sleep;\\        | Death is something desirable – devoutly  |\n| To sleep: perchance to    | to be wished, a consummation – a perfect |\n| dream: ay, there’s the    | closure. It’s nothing more than a sleep. |\n| rub;\\                     | But there’s a catch, which Hamlet calls  |\n| For in that sleep of      | a rub. A ‘rub’ is a bowls term meaning   |\n| death what dreams may     | an obstacle on the bowls lawn that       |\n| come\\                     | diverts the bowl, so the fear of the     |\n| When we have shuffled off | life hereafter is the obstacle that      |\n| this mortal coil,\\        | makes us pause and perhaps change the    |\n| Must give us pause:       | direction of our thinking. We don’t      |\n| there’s the respect\\      | control our dreams so what dreams may    |\n| That makes calamity of so | come in that sleep in which we have      |\n| long life;\\               | shuffled off all the fuss and bother of  |\n| For who would bear the    | life? He uses the term \"mortal           |\n| *whips and scorns of      | coil[^5]\", which is an Elizabethan       |\n| time*,\\                   | word for a big fuss. With that thought,  |\n| The oppressor’s wrong,    | Hamlet stops to reconsider. What will    |\n| the proud man’s           | happen when we have discarded all the    |\n| contumely,\\               | hustle and bustle of life?               |\n| The pangs of despised     |                                          |\n| love, the law’s delay,\\   |                                          |\n| The insolence of office   |                                          |\n| and the spurns\\           |                                          |\n| That patient merit of the |                                          |\n| unworthy takes,\\          |                                          |\n| When he himself might his |                                          |\n| quietus make\\             |                                          |\n| With a bare bodkin? who   |                                          |\n| would fardels bear,\\      |                                          |\n| To *grunt and sweat under |                                          |\n| a weary life*,            |                                          |\n+---------------------------+------------------------------------------+\n| But that the *dread of    | *The problem with the proposition* is    |\n| something* after death,\\  | that the sleep of death is unknown and   |\n| The *undiscover’d         | could be worse than life.                |\n| country* from whose       |                                          |\n| bourn\\                    | Hamlet now lets his imagination wander   |\n| No traveller returns,     | on the subject of the voyages of         |\n| *puzzles the will*\\       | discovery and the exploratory            |\n| And makes us rather bear  | expeditions.

What do you\nreckon was Hamlet's problem? In this soliloquy, Hamlet gives a list of\nall the *random* things that annoy him about life: *the whips and scorns\nof time*, *the oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, the pangs\nof despised love, the law’s delay, the insolence of office and the\nspurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes*. There’s a sense of\nagonized frustration in this soliloquy that however bad life is we’re\nprevented from doing anything about it by fear of the unknown.\n\nAnd yet, being Prince of Denmark, and having a lot of Questions, and\nunmistakable Authority, he has to Act! How did he solve that problem? We\ndon't know for sure if Hamlet believed in Goddess Saraswati,\n<u>[Shakespeare doesn't say, but Christopher Isherwood seems to think\nso, on Page\n3](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/35825580/vedanta-for-the-western-world-swami-vivekananda)</u>.\n\nAside: in Hindu mythology, who are the two who went into Hamlet's *\"the\nundiscover’d country\"* and *did return*?\n<u>[She](https://www.heartfulnessmagazine.com/a-story-of-everlasting-love)</u>\nand <u>[he](https://www.templepurohit.com/story-nachiketa-yama/)</u>.\nBut how did they manage it?\n\nYes, they asked\n<u>[Questions](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/pablo_picasso_102018)</u>!\n\n## Suppose we were Hamlet....\n\nWhat would we want to know? What Questions would we have?\n\n-   Who is our friend?\n-   What is the chance that we will survive?\n-   Who killed Dad?\n\nDid Hamlet have an idea, any suspicion, that he might have wanted to\nprove? Yes, he did, and that is why he *feigned madness*, so people\nwould open up and tell him things, in an unguarded way. So there was\n<u>[**craft in his\nmadness**](http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/hamlet/antichamlet.html)!!</u>\n\nSo here Hamlet tells his friends, Horatio and Marcellus, what he is\ngoing to do, and swears them into silence:\n\n> Here as before. \\[For the third time, Hamlet places his sword for the\n> others to swear upon\\]\\\n> Never, so help you mercy,\\\n> How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself\\\n> (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet\\\n> To put an antic disposition on)\\\n> That you at such time seeing me never shall,\\\n> With arms encumbered thus, or thus head shaked,\\\n> Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase\\\n> As, \"Well, we know,\" or \"We could an if we would,\"\\\n> And especially don't say <u>[**Hakuna Matata,\n> Dude!!**](https://youtu.be/kaOIxll4LCA)</u>\n\n### A Hypothesis worthy of Hamlet\n\nSo we know what *Hamlet* wanted to know, and how he planned to find out.\n\nWhat about us?\n\nIf we wanted to know the truth of something, some guess, a hunch, or a\n**Hypothesis** that we had, then we would need to conduct an\n\"Experiment\", rather like Hamlet did, without quite going or *feigning\nmadness* of course. But there is a *Madness to/in the Method*, as we\nwill see...\n\n![\"Design of Experiments - A Workflow: A Madness in the\nMethod\"](https://www.statsref.com/HTML/ppdac.png)\n\nFrom\n<u>[**StatsRef**](https://www.statsref.com/HTML/?statistics__statistical_analys.html)</u>\n:\n\n> The PPDAC summary table suggests a relatively linear flow from problem\n> definition/Hypothesis through to conclusions --- this is typically not\n> the case. It is often better to see the process as cyclical, with a\n> series of feedback loops. A summary of a revised PPDAC approach is\n> shown in the diagram below. As can be seen, although the clockwise\n> sequence (1→5) applies as the principal flow, each stage may and often\n> will feed back to the previous stage.\n\n> In addition, it may well be beneficial to examine the process in the\n> reverse direction, starting with Problem definition and then examining\n> expectations as to the format and structure of the Conclusions\n> (without pre-judging the outcomes!). This procedure then continues,\n> step-by-step, in an anti-clockwise manner (e→a) determining the\n> implications of these expectations for each stage of the process.\n\n## Design of Experiments\n\nLet us pretend we are Hamlet and design a simple experiment to find out\nsome \"truth\" (highly probable idea) that is important to us.\n\n### <u>[**No Free Hunch**](https://nofreehunch.org)</u>: Hypothesis Design\n\nWe learnt a lot (new) words from Hamlet, didn't we? How many do we\nremember? What Hypothesis could be make? What do we have a hunch about?\n\nLet us consider the <u>[**Short Term\nMemory(STM)**](Lawrence-ADesignofExperimentsWorkshopasanIntroductiontoStatistics.pdf)</u>\nof Foundation Students at SMI as our vehicle for testing similar\nHypotheses.[^1]\n\n-   STM scores are significantly different between students of Design\n    and those of Art (;-O)\n-   STM is much better for those who use Windows as compared to those\n    who use Macs\n-   Any other factors, not related to types of individuals, but more\n    like *parameters of STM itself*, also affect the STM scores, for\n    example:\n    -   Word complexity (Syllables per Word)\n    -   No of Words\n    -   Exposure Time and Recall Time\n\nWith the Guilford Divergent Thinking Test, you might consider:\n\n-   Students who speak their Mother Tongue fluently score better in\n    Divergent Thinking Scores (Fluency, Flexibility, Elaboration,\n    Originality)\n-   There is a significant difference in Guilford Scores between\n    students from \"small towns\" and those from metros.\n\n### Factors in Hypothesis\n\nIn each of these Hypotheses, we can see that there are *binary* (Yes/No)\n(two-valued) parameters that are part of the test: `Art vs Design`,\n`Windows vs Mac`, `Speaks Mother Tongue or Not`, `Small Town vs Metro`,\n`Long vs Short List of Words`, `Short vs Long Words` and\n`Long vs Short Exposure`.\n\nIf we want our experiment to be **fair** we must have:\n\n-   Devise a test tool for each combination of binary parameters (*Test\n    Type*)\n-   the **same number** of subjects for each Test Type\n-   **randomly** select the people as *respondents* each Test Type\n\nWe will choose one of these questions, or a similar one, and use the\n**PPDAC Method** to proceed with our Experiment. This paper by Lawrence\nto guide our Hypothesis Testing and the Design of our Experiment:\n\n<u>[**Lawrence - A Design of Experiments Workshop as an Introduction to\nStatistics -\nPDF**](Lawrence-ADesignofExperimentsWorkshopasanIntroductiontoStatistics.pdf)</u>).\n\nThis is the paper describing a simple *Design of Experiments* workshop\nin class much like ours. We will try to mimic as much of this as we can.\nDo read through this in the evening today in preparation for our\nexperiment.\n\n### Data Analysis-1: Comparison of STM Histograms using Excel and WTFcsv\n\nOnce our test/survey is complete, let us collate all the data for all\ntests using this Excel <u>[**spreadsheet**](STM.xlsx)</u>, which we can\nplace on Google Drive for the whole class. (This is for the STM\nHypothesis; we can adapt this spreadsheet for any other hypothesis test\nwith categorical factors andscores.)\n\n1.  Enter the data from all tests on the first sheet titled \"RawData\"\n    (the one with the warning)\n2.  Download and save as your own *named* local copy.\n3.  **Duplicate this data** on the sheet titled \"Data Duplicated\". **Do\n    not touch** the \"RawData\" sheet again. Good Practice to not touch\n    original data!!\n4.  For each of the *factors* under consideration, we will need to stack\n    up STM scores from $2^3 = 8$ tests, i.e. eight columns.\n5.  If we have three two-valued, categorical factors, we will get three\n    sets of stacked scores, each from a (shuffled) set of the tests.\n6.  Half the scores in these stacked columns will pertain to one *level*\n    of the factor, and the other half of the scores will pertain to the\n    other level. (This should remind you of the Karnaugh Map you may\n    have learnt in your digital logic courses in school.). See example\n    below: it shows how we can stack up the scores from *4* tests for\n    each *level* of the parameter *p1*.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| scores | test |  p1   |  p2   |  p3   |\n|:------:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|   20   |  A   | True  | Long  |  Big  |\n|   20   |  B   | True  | Long  | Small |\n|   20   |  C   | True  | Short |  Big  |\n|   20   |  D   | True  | Short | Small |\n|   20   |  E   | False | Long  |  Big  |\n|   20   |  F   | False | Long  | Small |\n|   20   |  G   | False | Short |  Big  |\n|   20   |  H   | False | Short | Small |\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n1.  We will set up each of these *two stacked-score columns* in Col A on\n    separate sheets, similar to the one shown in the sheet titled\n    \"Permutation Test\". One sheet for each two-valued parameter.\n2.  Create *paired* Histograms for each of the two stacked-score columns\n    using WTFcsv, or Excel itself if you are confident. Ensure that\n    there are *TWO* Histograms: one for each value of the factor under\n    consideration.\n3.  Inspection of the shapes and locations of these paired Histograms\n    may give you an idea whether the factor under consideration has any\n    effect on STM scores or none.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n4.  Save these 6 histograms as PNG files on your machines and use them\n    along with *Comic Generator* (discussed below) to tell the story of\n    your Hypothesis Testing.\n\n### Computing Parallel Worlds: The Permutation Test\n\nBTW, why did Gabbar Singh say to Kaalia and the others in Sholay,\n<u>[\"Hum ko kuchh nahi pata\"](https://youtu.be/chi9hsfYcDE)?</u> And\nthen afterwards, \"Kamal ho gaya\"...why does he say that?\n\nWhat if we cannot trust our eyes to compare the pair-wise Histograms? If\nthere was considerable overlap? Is there a better way? Can we fix this\nby playing another Childhood Game? Yes, with **a deck of cards**! But\nbefore we play with cards, some background:\n\n> From: ~~Gabbar Singh~~ Tim C.

We will execute on Permutation Test on one sheet step by step and\n    decide whether that factor had a significant *effect* on STM scores.\n2.  We **pretend** that there is no difference in scores whether the\n    factor is chosen on way or another.\n3.  We **mechanize this pretence** by lumping \"both kinds\" of scores\n    together and shuffle them and divide them, **randomly** into two\n    groups, and take the difference in scores.\n4.  We can do this, like we did with our Monte Carlo experiment, many\n    many times and calculate difference in scores each time. (It is like\n    inventing many parallel worlds)\n5.  If we look at the way these **randomly computed** scores are\n    distributed and **compare** with the one measurement we did see, we\n    can decide whether Mother Nature is up to something, or we are able\n    to mimic the Mom.\n6.  If we are **not** able to mimic Mom, then **Mom always knows** and\n    we bow to her and ascribe a significance to the factor under\n    consideration. Else, nope.\n7.  Replicate this test for the other (binary) factors.\n\nApropos: how could we do this for non-binary factors ...??!!!\n\n### Making a Data Comic out of our Experiment\n\nWhat have been our Conclusions with the Experiment?
