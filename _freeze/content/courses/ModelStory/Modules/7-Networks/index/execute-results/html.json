Do you think\nthat you are **outside the herd**, and that what you think or do is from\nyour own mind?\n\nAnyways...\n\n## Activities\n\n### Activity: Secret Santa Game\n\nLet us play this in the vanilla way: Paper chits with names in a bin and\ndrawing them in turn. What can go wrong with this? Ask [Avni\nGupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avni-gupta-551014267/).\n\nShould we use this instead?\n<u><https://www.drawnames.com.sg/secret-santa-generator></u>\n\nDiscussion:\n`Nodes, Links, Link Directionality, Connected and Disconnected Networks`\n\n### Activity: Barabasi Cocktail Party Game\n\nThis is a game \"invented\" by Alberto-Laszlo Barabasi, a Network Science\npioneer and expert, who has written a wonderful, and wonderfully\nacessible, book on Network Science, available online\n<u><http://networksciencebook.com/></u>\n\n1.  Please take a coin in your hand. (A rupee coin is good!)\n2.  Find a ~~stranger~~ potential new friend in the classroom. Both of\n    you toss your coins.\n3.  If the coins show two Heads or two Tails, introduce yourselves, make\n    small talk, exchange classroom and college gossip. 2 Minutes!\n4.  Make a note of your new friends initials.\n5.  We will plot this conversation on the board. How?\n\n{{< vimeo 191074419 >}}\n\nDiscussion:\n`Network Mechanisms, Information Flow, Giant Component, Emergence`\n\n### Activity: Indian Surnames Game\n\n1.  How many common Indian surnames do we know? Let us write them on the\n    board.\n2.  Each of us will now look at each surname and recollect how many\n    people they know with that surname.\n3.  Write down the score for each surname.\n4.  Let's plot this on (yet another) network!!\n\nDiscussion:\n`Node Degree, Giant Component?  Small Worlds?  Multi-Link network, Link Values or Costs`\n\n### Activity: Hi, I am Kevin Bacon, SMI Foundation 2023 Batch\n\nLet us find a Keven Bacon in SMI Foundation Studies Programme!! Six\nDegrees of Separation...or of Kevin Bacon?\n\nLook at this video before you proceed!\n\n{{< vimeo 14196818 >}}\n\n1.  Collect friends Data from across college/class, import and plot,\n    analyze and comment\n2.  Use this online tool at DataBasic.io <u><https://databasic.io></u>\n    to *Connect the Dots*, OR\n3.  Even more fun at at GraphCommons\n    <u><https://graphcommons.com/graphs/new></u>\n\nDiscussion: `Node Degree, Centrality, Betweenness, Link Values or Costs`\n\n### Activity: Can you Introduce me to Chandler, again?\n\n1.  Take your favourite Literary Work / TV Serial / Movie and create a\n    Network Database for it.\n\n2.  How? Use conversations between pairs of individuals (`nodes`) to\n    create links. E.g. each distinct conversation is a `link`, and the\n    number of sentences uttered is the `weight` of the link.\n\n3.  Visualize it either with or without tech tools From Teach\n    Engineering, this Activity Sheet\n    <u><https://www.teachengineering.org/activities/view/uno_graphtheory_lesson01_activity2></u>.\n\n**Hah! Engineering in a Design college!!**üòÄ\n\n3.  Can also use [Graph Comics](https://aviz.fr/~bbach/graphcomics/)\n    <u><https://aviz.fr/~bbach/graphcomics/></u>\n\nDiscussion:\n`Networks are everywhere, Cannot \"unsee\" them, You are a node and you are a link...are you?`\n\n### Activity: Way-Spotting Game\n\nNow that we have an idea of `nodes`, `links` and `costs`, let us get an\nexperience of some more network science ideas:\n\n1.  Make groups of 3.\n2.  Head over to <u><http://www.wayspotting.com/index.html></u>\n3.  Play!! Make a note of your route each time ( your \"traversal\" of the\n    network)\n4.  Note if you can see the following:\n    -   Frequently Used Nodes\n    -   Frequently used Links\n5.
