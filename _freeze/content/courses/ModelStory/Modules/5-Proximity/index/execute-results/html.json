In\n>     Kandinsky's case, the sense of hearing was associated with the\n>     sense of sight, sounds, and colors being intimately linked in his\n>     mind. He could therefore \" see music \" as he found himself\n>     following a performance of Wagner's *Lohengrin*.\n\n> 2.  **He became an artist at the age of 30.** In December 1896,\n>     Kandinsky left his homeland and moved to Munich with his wife,\n>     Ania Tchimiakina, in order to start a career as an artist. It was\n>     a radical move, a true departure. The artist was already 30-years\n>     old and left behind a respectable life, conforming to the\n>     conventions dictated by his family lineage.\n\n> 3.  **He opened his own school in 1902: it was open to women.** At the\n>     beginning of 1902, the Phalanx (group and school opposed to\n>     conventional and conservative art viewpoints) of which Kandinsky\n>     was president, opened a painting school in Schwabing. Kandinsky\n>     taught painting and drawing there. The school was open to women\n>     from its inception. This position was non-conformist and\n>     progressive, since, at the time, women were only admitted to the\n>     Society of Women Artists, an institution linked to the Munich\n>     Academy of Fine Arts, or to the evening classes of that Academy.\n\n> 4.  **He was friends with Marcel Duchamp.** European avant-garde made\n>     its official entry into the United States in 1913 at the Armory\n>     Show in New York. Kandinsky exhibited Improvisation 27, which\n>     artist and gallery owner Alfred Stieglitz bought to defend him\n>     against criticism. Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase\n>     was a scandalous success. Another scandal followed in 1917 when\n>     Duchamp presented a urinal claiming artwork status to the hanging\n>     committee of the Salon of independent artists of which he is a\n>     member: Fountain became history, formalizing the invention of the\n>     ready-made, a radical innovation which establishes an art of the\n>     idea and positions Duchamp in art history.\n\n> 5.  **He was a member of the \" Blue Four\" group** The German Galka\n>     Scheyer, who emigrated to New York in 1924, was the founder of the\n>     Blue Four group. After successful avant-garde exhibitions, he\n>     founded the influential Munich group Der Blaue Reiter (“The Blue\n>     Rider”; 1911–14) and began completely abstract painting. His forms\n>     evolved from fluid and organic to geometric and, finally, to\n>     pictographic (e.g., Tempered Élan, 1944).\n\nHere is a link to his <u>[**Top 40\nPaintings.**](https://www.wassilykandinsky.net/painting1896-1944.php)</u>\n\nLet us listen to Mathew Ritchie tell us about Kandinsky.\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oxS2TM182I >}}\n\n\n### The Math in Kandinsky\n\nHere is a brief paper discussing the <u>[**Math-Art of Wassily\nKandinsky.**](/pdf/Proximity/Kandinsky-MathArtist.pdf)</u>\n\nWhat are the Key Insights from this paper?\n\n-   A very spatial aspect to his paintings?\n-   Metaphoric Correspondence between Emotions and Colours/Shapes\n-   Do we use Similar Language?\n-   Geometry pervades our lives\n-   Proximity can be interpreted in many ways\n\n## Using Proximity as a Model\n\nCan we use Proximity as a measure to quantify our experiences? What sort\nof experiences? What emotions could be involved? How can we attach\n*numerical significance* to those emotions?\n\n### Walking the Streets in Soho\n\n<u><https://www.wikiwand.com/en/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak></u>\n\nAre you thirsty? Would you like some water?\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNjrAXGRda4 >}}\n\n### A Proximity Effect\n\nLet us play this <u>[**Vaccination\nGame**](https://rocs.hu-berlin.de/D3/herd/)</u>.\n\n### Fun Stuff with Kandinsky\n\nLet's also become synaesthetic, however temporarily, and make music with\nKandinsky !!\n\n> CHROME MUSIC LAB:KANDINSKY This experiment is inspired by Wassily\n> Kandinsky, an artist who compared painting to making music. It turns\n> anything you draw – lines, circles, triangles, or scribbles – into\n> sound.\n\n<u>[**Kandinsky Music Maker: Music by\nPainting**](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/kandinsky/)</u>\n\n### How to say, \"You are standing too close to me?\"\n\nCan we ask Sting? <u><https://youtu.be/KNIZofPB8ZM></u>\n\nMaybe not. There are better Models, may be!!\n\n## References\n\n1.  Dirk Brockman - <u>[This message must be Herd -\n    PDF](/pdf/Proximity/Brockman-ThisMessageMustBeHerd.pdf)</u>\n2.  P. Bingham, N.Q.
