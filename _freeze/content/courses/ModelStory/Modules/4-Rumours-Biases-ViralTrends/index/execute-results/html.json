When you hear the church bell tolling for someone who has\n> died, don’t ask who it is, Donne says, just know that it’s tolling for\n> you too because you are part of the same society and the death of\n> anyone takes a part of your own life away.\n\nDoes the Bell toll for thee?\n\n### The Game of the Polygons\n\nLet us explore, sadly, the `dark side` of Game Theory. Where our own\nagent-like actions lead to bad outcomes in Society...\n\nAlways?\n\nNot if we...choose to copy others wisely !!\n\nLet us play <u>**The Game of the Polygons** [(web\nlink)](https://ncase.me/polygons/)</u>\n\n### Another Dark Side of...\n\nWhy are Petrol Stations located next to each other? Here is the\n**Hotelling's Phenomenon**, explained.\\\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4cKzGj58q4 >}}\n\n## Viral Trends...With a Song?\n\nA Song that is all about Network Effects !!!\n\nSong: Kuchh Toh Log Kahenge\\\nSinger: Kishore Kumar\\\nMusic: R.

Can you <u>[**be\n    vaccinated** against\n    rumours](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/epidemonic/)</u>?\n    Is there a game-theoretic cost for the vaccination?\n-   How does one be *individual and different* and still *one of the\n    gang*? Is it possible [to be inside and outside the group]{.black .bg-washed-red} at the same time? Is it a good idea <u>[to be an insider and an outsider at the same\n    time?](https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/insider-partial)</u>\n- How do <u>[Echo\n    Chambers](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/echo-chambers/)</u> work?\n-   How does on think of products and ads, or policy messages? (Remember\n    the <u>[\"Bell Bajaao\" campaign?](https://youtu.be/zmNz0cTcxFU)</u>\n-   There are popular and well-known phrases and memes in every\n    language! Use them!!\n-   Here is one for you: \"Less Than Three!\"\n\n## Conclusions\n\n-   Individual Actions Matter. Because they can be \"reverse infections\"\n    **and** be contagious, in a positive way.\n-   Correlations between Individual Actions can create \"standing waves\"\n    or \"echoes\" on the fabric of society.\n    -   Whatsapp \"echo chambers\"\n    -   Popularity of Memes, Songs, and Movie lines\n    -   Taglines from Ads, and Products ( e.g. \"Think Different\". Bah.)\n\n## References\n\n1.

Science(337) 49.\n    Available here <u><https://sci-hub.se/10.1126/science.1217330></u>. The term “network interventions” describes the process of using social network data to accelerate behavior change or improve organizational performance. In this Review, four strategies for network interventions are described, each of which has multiple tactical alternatives.\n\n5.  Nicholas Christakis. (May 3, 2024). To exploit social contagion,\n    tools are needed to efficiently identify individuals who are better\n    able to initiate cascades. To be maximally useful, such tools should\n    be deployable without having to actually map face-to-face social\n    network interactions. <https://t.co/DHCKxXeGYg>. This is a paper that presents design tools that exploit the \"Friendship Paradox\" to create Social Contagion. A quick summary of the paper is available here. <u><https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi5147></u>\n",
