    "text": "The Science of Surprise\nLet us then examine the street traffic data we have gathered for any ‚Äúmodel-like‚Äù pattern! Is our data clean? Do we have two columns of data, one containing 60counts of vehicles, and the other containing inter-vehicular gap times in seconds?\nWe will use a tool called, ah‚Ä¶umm‚Ä¶ahem‚Ä¶er‚Ä¶WTFcsv. Let us first quickly see what this tool offers us!\n\n   \nLet us import our data into the WTFcsv tool and see what patterns lurk beneath our data!\nDiscussion-1\n\nThere were similar patterns in everybody‚Äôs data üòÆ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we saw was an example of the Poisson Arrival Process.\nThis has applications in Service Design, Traffic Management, Logistics, Finding Defects in Materials, Weather Modelling, Pest Control‚Ä¶\n\nFrom https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/297375:\n\n(Say) Lambda(\\(\\lambda\\)) is the average number of cars that pass per unit of time, let‚Äôs say 60/hour (\\(\\lambda\\) = 60). We know, however, that the actual number will vary - some days more, some days less. The Poisson Distribution allows us to model this variability.\nNow, an average of 60 cars per hour equates to an average of 1 car passing by each minute. Again though, we know there‚Äôs going to be variability in the amount of time between arrivals: Sometimes more than 1 minute; other times less. The Exponential Distribution allows us to model this variability.\nAll that being said, cars passing by on a road won‚Äôt always follow a Poisson Process. If there‚Äôs a traffic signal just around the corner, for example, arrivals are going to be bunched up instead of steady. On an open highway, a slow tractor-trailer may hold up a long line of cars, again causing bunching. In these cases, the Poisson Distribution may still work okay for longer time periods, but the exponential will fail badly in modeling arrival times.\nNote also that there is huge variability based on time of day: busier during commuting times; much slower at 3am. Make sure that your lambda is reflective of the specific time period you are considering.\n\nLambda then becomes a parameter of the model. And the higher the \\(\\lambda\\), the more the traffic. Hence shorter the average inter-vehicular gap time, which is \\(\\Large{\\sim \\frac{1}{\\lambda}}\\).\n\nSo everything random is not really random?\nIs anything random at all?\nDoes seeing a pattern make it ‚Äúnot random‚Äù?\nAre we just Victims of Randomness and cannot do much else but put up with it?",

    "text": "Poisson Distribution as a 4As Complexity Idea‚Ä¶\nConsider a coin toss. One gets HEAD(H) or TAIL(T), and if the coin is fair, the long term chances of getting a H or a T are even. If one tosses a single coin several times, one gets different sequences of Hs and Ts.\nIf we assume that an H means people get into their car and drive, what can we say of many many people? They are all tossing coins, so to speak, and leave only if they get a H. Each sequence of Hs and Ts is a manifestation of car traffic, with H being a vehicle, and T being no vehicle.\nIn a large society with \\(\\large{n~ -&gt; \\infty}\\), not many people drive out at any given time, so \\(p\\) is low. So the product \\(\\large{people \\times p(H) = np}\\) can be thought of as a constant, say 10, or 100.\nThe Accumulated random binary Actions of a large number of people gives us an aggregate Poisson distribution for the occurrence of traffic, with a mean of \\(\\large{\\lambda = np}\\).",

    "text": "Introduction\nMeeting Kandinsky\nHave you heard of a painter called Wassily Kandinksy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract from https://artsandculture.google.com/story/QgUxxeY10_VADg\n\n\n\nHe had the gift of synesthesia. Kandinsky was capable of synesthesia, an involuntary neurological phenomenon by which a person perceives several senses as being associated. In Kandinsky‚Äôs case, the sense of hearing was associated with the sense of sight, sounds, and colors being intimately linked in his mind. He could therefore ‚Äù see music ‚Äù as he found himself following a performance of Wagner‚Äôs Lohengrin.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe became an artist at the age of 30. In December 1896, Kandinsky left his homeland and moved to Munich with his wife, Ania Tchimiakina, in order to start a career as an artist. It was a radical move, a true departure. The artist was already 30-years old and left behind a respectable life, conforming to the conventions dictated by his family lineage.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe opened his own school in 1902: it was open to women. At the beginning of 1902, the Phalanx (group and school opposed to conventional and conservative art viewpoints) of which Kandinsky was president, opened a painting school in Schwabing. Kandinsky taught painting and drawing there. The school was open to women from its inception. This position was non-conformist and progressive, since, at the time, women were only admitted to the Society of Women Artists, an institution linked to the Munich Academy of Fine Arts, or to the evening classes of that Academy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was friends with Marcel Duchamp. European avant-garde made its official entry into the United States in 1913 at the Armory Show in New York. Kandinsky exhibited Improvisation 27, which artist and gallery owner Alfred Stieglitz bought to defend him against criticism. Marcel Duchamp‚Äôs Nude Descending a Staircase was a scandalous success. Another scandal followed in 1917 when Duchamp presented a urinal claiming artwork status to the hanging committee of the Salon of independent artists of which he is a member: Fountain became history, formalizing the invention of the ready-made, a radical innovation which establishes an art of the idea and positions Duchamp in art history.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was a member of the ‚Äù Blue Four‚Äù group The German Galka Scheyer, who emigrated to New York in 1924, was the founder of the Blue Four group. After successful avant-garde exhibitions, he founded the influential Munich group Der Blaue Reiter (‚ÄúThe Blue Rider‚Äù; 1911‚Äì14) and began completely abstract painting. His forms evolved from fluid and organic to geometric and, finally, to pictographic (e.g., Tempered √âlan, 1944).\n\n\nHere is a link to his Top 40 Paintings.\nLet us listen to Mathew Ritchie tell us about Kandinsky.\n\nThe Math in Kandinsky\nHere is a brief paper discussing the Math-Art of Wassily Kandinsky.\nWhat are the Key Insights from this paper?\n\nA very spatial aspect to his paintings?\nMetaphoric Correspondence between Emotions and Colours/Shapes\nDo we use Similar Language?\nGeometry pervades our lives\nProximity can be interpreted in many ways",

The symbols may be letters, bits, or decimal digits, among other possibilities. For example, the Hamming distance between: ‚Äúkarolin‚Äù and ‚Äúkathrin‚Äù is 3. ‚Äúkarolin‚Äù and ‚Äúkerstin‚Äù is 3. ‚Äúkathrin‚Äù and ‚Äúkerstin‚Äù is 4. 0000 and 1111 is 4. 2173896 and 2233796 is 3.\n\nThe Hamming Distance can be calculated using a logical operation known as ‚ÄúExclusive-OR‚Äù or ‚ÄúXOR‚Äù.\nGreat Circle Distances\nHow would you measure distance over a curved surface such as the earth?\nView the path here: https://www.greatcirclemap.com/ Calculate distances here: https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/calculators\nTaxicab Distances\nAnd if a man hatta live in New York?\n\n\nWe will use the Euclidean and maybe other concepts of distance when we get into our Machine Learning models!\nPlotting Sihouette Diagrams\nTo be written up!! https://orange3.readthedocs.io/projects/orange-visual-programming/en/latest/widgets/visualize/silhouetteplot.html",

    "text": "So where are all these Proximities used?\nProximities in the GPS System\nThe GPS system is all about wanting to know if one is proximate to a desired landmark! But how does it work?\nBased on a measurement of two proximity scores, both electronic. One in Space and one in Time. Oooh, cryptic, isn‚Äôt it? Here is how it works:\n\nUsers receive GPS transmissions from more than one satellite (to improve accuracy; more later).\nEach Satellite is given a unique digital signature code, called its Coarse/Acquisition, or C/A Code.\nThis code is a digital one-zero based sequence, which repeats after a week.\nThe code ones and zeroes are called chips; the chips are output by each satellite at a rate of 1.023 MHz. ( i.e.¬†a little faster than a million chips per second)\nAll satellites use an on-board time clock. All satellites are synchronized and it is the same time on all satellites, regardless of where they are in the sky.\nA User Receiver cannot understand what the satellite is saying, UNLESS it removes/wipes off the signature used by the satellite. So think of this in proximity terms: the user needs to know the Signature Sequence and also be in sync aligned with it, chip for chip.\nOne the signature is removed, what remains is what the satellite is saying.\n\nGPS#5 ‡§â‡§µ‡§æ‡§ö:\n\n‚ÄúIt is 4 PM on my onboard clock‚Äù;\n‚ÄúThe ionosphere is doing weird things so please include that weirdness in your position computation etc‚Äù;\nOther stuff, called the satellite ephimeris (which we may discuss in class)\n\n\n\nBut Houston, we have a problem, but right here on the ground, mercifully. The problem is, wait for it, the Speed of Light. And it is a good problem to have.\n\nWhen you detect say GPS#5 saying it is 4 PM, that signal came from GPS#5 to you at the speed of light, so by the time it arrives, the time on the satellite is already 4PM + 150 microseconds.\nSince different GPS satellites we can see are at different ranges, we receive different times from 5 different GPS satellites.\n\nThen we can set up a set of linear matrix equations in these variables:\n\n‚ÄúReceived Time‚Äù from each satellite (Pseudo-Range)\nLong and Lat (called a Position Fix);\nAbsolute Time (Time Fix)\n\n\nWhich we solve to obtain both Position Fix and Time Fix.\n\nSo in summary, the user needs to calculate two proximities:\n\nA C/A code proximity, measured by the Hamming Distance between the received code and a locally generated C/A code. Which code to generate locally? We don‚Äôt really know, so we generate ~ all. Huh. And select that C/A code to wipe off which shows good proximity with received C/A code. (This is called, in telecom language, a Code Matched Filter and Rake Receiver. Ask me what this looks like, at your peril.)\nA Time Proximity, by correcting its own local clock to match the satellite clocks, accurately. (This is called, in telecom language again, a Delay-Lock Loop. Peril again.)\nCode Proximity Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Code Proximity Measure\n\n\nIn the Figure¬†1 above, the red curve shows the Hamming Distance between a received C/A code, and its locally generated copy. Only when the proximity between them is within one-chip does the measure have any sensible amplitude. (This is called Autocorrelation.)\nThe blue curve show Hamming Distance proximity between a received C/A code and any other C/A code. At no overlap position do these dissimilar codes have a useful proximity measure. (This is known as Cross-Correlation).\nC/A codes are designed to have that spike-like autocorrelation, and that fuzz like cross-correlation to aid in proximity-based synchronization and code wipe-off.\nA Brief Foray into Cryptography\nIn the Sherlock Holmes story,The Adventure of the Dancing Men, a criminal known the one of the characters communicates with her using a childish/child-like drawing which looks like this:\n In this message, each character is a visual representation, or a substution for, a letter from the alphabet. The characters with flags are the first letter of a new word. The message is translated in the story as ‚ÄúAm here, Abe Slaney‚Äù.\nThe entire code alphabet is shown in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code is a good example of a Substitution Cipher with non-text substition. See https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/dancing-men-cipher and https://www.dcode.fr/dancing-men-cipher for examples where you can encode and decode your own text, and send them to friends. üòé üòº\nThe intent behind any substitution cipher is to be create distance from the original message, or characters. The algorithms to encode and decode uses this idea of distance to perform their operations and are entirely reversible.",

How would you get other people to join in?\nIf you want a whole bunch of 20-30-something people to raise their arms up and spontaneously rock side to side?\n\nAnd, what does ‚Äúless than three‚Äù even mean?!!??\nIn the previous module on the Prisoners‚Äô Dilemma, we saw how we all are engaged in adversarial and transactional Games with many other people, most of whom are strangers to us. But as remarked before, the Human Species is perhaps unique in that we are able to cooperate with strangers and possess bourgeois virtues!! So we are not always adversaries or enemies, and we are able to obtain unspoken agreement and correspondence with strangers.\nWhat use would this be? Would it be a Design Tool? How?\nToday, we will study Coordination Games and Schelling Focus Points, and see how these concepts can help create better designs, businesses, and maybe, art.",

Rewards for C are always the greatest!\nThere are two Nash equilibria in the Stag hunt game. The CC corner is representative of both players being pro-risk and cooperating for higher reward. The DD corner is where each Player is risk-averse and prefers to work by themselves and mind their own business, without interference to, or help from, the other Player.\nThe Stag Hunt is a less vindictive than the Prisoners‚Äô Dilemma and may be preferable in situations where there is not so much of an adversarial engagement as there is a tendency to maximize gains and minimize risks.",

Using these as a starting point, we will create Models and make sense of these human experiences.\nThese Models may resemble a Thought Experiment, or a Diagram, or a simple Procedure, or a piece of Computer Code, or even a Cultural Tradition. The Models will be understood, internalized, fitted in with what we already know, and generalized to new situations and applications. This will done with the help of activities based on games, pranks, memes, videos, movie-clips, art-related activities, open source software tools, field experiments, field visits, readings, additional readings, writings, more writings, still more writings, and seemingly endless discussions..\nThe Models should thusly provide data and directions for artistic and design endeavours. In effect, we will go from Stories to Data rather than the other way around. At the end of the Unit, the tired, but happy students will use the gamut of Models / Tools / Techniques encountered in class to design an artifact or performance, working individually or in teams.",

We will read just a wee bit of it in class.\nAnd here is Robert Axelrod on the RadioLab Podcast:\n\n\nSpotify:\n\n\n\n Transcript: https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/segments/104010-one-good-deed-deserves-another\nNash Equilibrium and Dominant Strategy in PD\nAre there COSTs to ACTIONs? Who decides?\nHow does one ACT to minimize costs and maximize rewards? Remember, we are all Agents, with our own vocabulary of Actions which we might use Again and again, and experience an Aggregate outcome in society.\nThe Payoff Matrix in PD is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrisoners‚Äô Dilemma Payoff Matrix\n\n\nPlayer #2\n\nPlayer #1\n\n\n\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\nC\n(R=3, R=3)\n(T=5, S=0)\n\n\nD\n(S=0, T=5)\n(P=1, P=1)\n\n\n\n\nPayoffs are (Player#1, Player#2)\n\n\nR = Reward; S = Sucker‚Äôs Payoff; T = Temptation; P = Punishment\n\n\nShaded Cells are Nash Equilibria\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that, in order for this to be a true Prisoners‚Äô Dilemma, we need:\n\\[\nTemptation &gt; Reward &gt; Punishment &gt; Sucker's~ Payoff\\\\\\\n\\] \\[\nR &gt; (S + T)/2\n\\] The first condition ensures that Temptation (to D) is always stronger than the Reward(for C); and the second ensures that the two Players cannot mutually agree to alternate between C and D and have a higher net reward !! Can you Game Game-Theory ? That‚Äôs a Cabal !!\nWherever you ‚Äúare‚Äù on the matrix, you can always improve your situation by defecting!! ‚ÄúD‚Äù is your best move, your ‚ÄúDominant Strategy‚Äù, because that is how the matrix is (numerically) stacked. And if both players do that, then we end up at the bottom-right cell, which says ‚Äú(D,D)‚Äù, where the game stays forever, in state called the ‚ÄúNash Equilibrium‚Äù.\nWhile just a little thought, even hesitation, could have led us ‚Äú(C, C)‚Äù‚Ä¶An altruistic decision to ‚ÄúC‚Äù first could tip the scales in favour of ‚Äú(C,C)‚Äù.\nSigh.",

The poem functions to ‚Äôpraise the beauty of music and its fluid expressive beauty, the ‚Äúspontaneous overflow of powerful feelings‚Äù that Wordsworth identified at the heart of poetry.The poet orders or requests his listeners to behold a young maiden reaping and singing to herself. The poet says that anyone passing by should either stop or gently pass as not to disturb her.\n\nPlaying with Sound\nSome dreaded trigonometry first!

The Models are intended to provide directions for artistic and design endeavours.\nThe Models will be understood, internalized, fitted in with what we already know, and generalized to new applications. This will done with the help of activities based on games, videos, art-related activities, open source software tools, field experiments, field visits, additional readings, writings and discussions.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nLet us read the famous soliloquy from Act 3, Scene 1 of Shakespeare‚Äôs Hamlet, prince of Denmark, the famous nunnery scene: Hamlet: To be or Not to be‚Ä¶\n\nHamlet‚Äôs ‚ÄòTo Be Or Not To Be‚Äô Speech, Act 3 Scene 1\n\n\n\nShakespeare\nTo be, or not to be: that is the question:\n\n\nPlain English (hopefully)\nThe first six words of the soliloquy establish a balance. There is a direct opposition ‚Äì to be, or not to be. Hamlet is thinking about life and death and pondering a state of being versus a state of not being ‚Äì being alive and being dead.\n\n\n\nWhether ‚Äôtis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\nAnd by opposing end them?\nThe balance continues with a consideration of the way one deals with life and death. Life is a lack of power: the living are at the mercy of the blows of outrageous fortune. Should we nobly suffer or should we take arms and fight against these random things?\n\n\nTo die: to sleep;\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\nThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks\nThat flesh is heir to, ‚Äôtis a consummation\nDevoutly to be wish‚Äôd.\n\nThe only action one can take against the things he lists among those blows is to end one‚Äôs life.\nThat‚Äôs the only way of opposing them. The ‚Äòsleep of death‚Äô is therefore empowering: killing oneself is a way of taking action, taking up arms, opposing and defeating the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Living is a passive state; dying is an active state.\n\n\n\nTo die, to sleep;\nTo sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there‚Äôs the rub;\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\nMust give us pause: there‚Äôs the respect\nThat makes calamity of so long life;\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\nThe oppressor‚Äôs wrong, the proud man‚Äôs contumely,\nThe pangs of despised love, the law‚Äôs delay,\nThe insolence of office and the spurns\nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\nWith a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\nDeath is something desirable ‚Äì devoutly to be wished, a consummation ‚Äì a perfect closure. It‚Äôs nothing more than a sleep. But there‚Äôs a catch, which Hamlet calls a rub. A ‚Äòrub‚Äô is a bowls term meaning an obstacle on the bowls lawn that diverts the bowl, so the fear of the life hereafter is the obstacle that makes us pause and perhaps change the direction of our thinking. We don‚Äôt control our dreams so what dreams may come in that sleep in which we have shuffled off all the fuss and bother of life? He uses the term ‚Äúmortal coil1‚Äù, which is an Elizabethan word for a big fuss. With that thought, Hamlet stops to reconsider. What will happen when we have discarded all the hustle and bustle of life?\n\n\nBut that the dread of something after death,\nThe undiscover‚Äôd country from whose bourn\nNo traveller returns, puzzles the will\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\n\nThe problem with the proposition is that the sleep of death is unknown and could be worse than life.\nHamlet now lets his imagination wander on the subject of the voyages of discovery and the exploratory expeditions. Dying is like crossing the border between known and unknown geography. One is likely to be lost in that un-mapped place, from which one would never return. The implication is that there may be un-imagined horrors in that land.\n\n\n\n\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all;\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\nIs sicklied o‚Äôer with the pale cast of thought,\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment\nWith this regard their currents turn awry,\nAnd lose the name of action.\n\n\n\nBut there is more to it than that. It is not just about killing himself but also about the mission he is on ‚Äì to avenge his father‚Äôs death by killing his father‚Äôs murderer. Throughout the action of the play, he makes excuses for not killing him and turns away when he has the chance. ‚ÄòConscience does make cowards of us all.‚Äô Convention demands that he kill Claudius but murder is a sin and that conflict is the core of the play.\nAt the end of the soliloquy, he pulls himself out of this reflective mode by deciding that too much thinking about it is the thing that will prevent the action he has to rise to.\n\n\n\n‚ÄìSoft you now! The fair Ophelia!\nNymph, in thy orisons\nBe all my sins remember‚Äôd.\nSaraswati Namostute ! Grant me Grace and Knowledge on How to Proceed!\n\n\n\nDo you see a lot of ‚Äúrandomness‚Äù in that famous soliloquy? What do you reckon was Hamlet‚Äôs problem? In this soliloquy, Hamlet gives a list of all the random things that annoy him about life: the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor‚Äôs wrong, the proud man‚Äôs contumely, the pangs of despised love, the law‚Äôs delay, the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes. There‚Äôs a sense of agonized frustration in this soliloquy that however bad life is we‚Äôre prevented from doing anything about it by fear of the unknown.\nAnd yet, being Prince of Denmark, and having a lot of Questions, and unmistakable Authority, he has to Act! How did he solve that problem? We don‚Äôt know for sure if Hamlet believed in Goddess Saraswati, Shakespeare doesn‚Äôt say, but Christopher Isherwood seems to think so, on Page 3.\nAside: in Hindu mythology, who are the two who went into Hamlet‚Äôs ‚Äúthe undiscover‚Äôd country‚Äù and did return? She and he. But how did they manage it?\nYes, they asked Questions!"

What Questions would we have?\n\nWho is our friend?\nWhat is the chance that we will survive?\nWho killed Dad?\n\nDid Hamlet have an idea, any suspicion, that he might have wanted to prove? Yes, he did, and that is why he feigned madness, so people would open up and tell him things, in an unguarded way. So there was craft in his madness!!\nSo here Hamlet tells his friends, Horatio and Marcellus, what he is going to do, and swears them into silence:\n\nHere as before. [For the third time, Hamlet places his sword for the others to swear upon]\nNever, so help you mercy,\nHow strange or odd soe‚Äôer I bear myself\n(As I perchance hereafter shall think meet\nTo put an antic disposition on)\nThat you at such time seeing me never shall,\nWith arms encumbered thus, or thus head shaked,\nOr by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase\nAs, ‚ÄúWell, we know,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe could an if we would,‚Äù\nAnd especially don‚Äôt say Hakuna Matata, Dude!!\n\nA Hypothesis worthy of Hamlet\nSo we know what Hamlet wanted to know, and how he planned to find out.\nWhat about us?\nIf we wanted to know the truth of something, some guess, a hunch, or a Hypothesis that we had, then we would need to conduct an ‚ÄúExperiment‚Äù, rather like Hamlet did, without quite going or feigning madness of course. But there is a Madness to/in the Method, as we will see‚Ä¶\n\n\n‚ÄúDesign of Experiments - A Workflow: A Madness in the Method‚Äù\n\nFrom StatsRef :\n\nThe PPDAC summary table suggests a relatively linear flow from problem definition/Hypothesis through to conclusions ‚Äî this is typically not the case. It is often better to see the process as cyclical, with a series of feedback loops. A summary of a revised PPDAC approach is shown in the diagram below. As can be seen, although the clockwise sequence (1‚Üí5) applies as the principal flow, each stage may and often will feed back to the previous stage.\n\n\nIn addition, it may well be beneficial to examine the process in the reverse direction, starting with Problem definition and then examining expectations as to the format and structure of the Conclusions (without pre-judging the outcomes!). This procedure then continues, step-by-step, in an anti-clockwise manner (e‚Üía) determining the implications of these expectations for each stage of the process."

    "text": "Design of Experiments\nLet us pretend we are Hamlet and design a simple experiment to find out some ‚Äútruth‚Äù (highly probable idea) that is important to us.\n\nNo Free Hunch: Hypothesis Design\nWe learnt a lot (new) words from Hamlet, didn‚Äôt we? How many do we remember? What Hypothesis could be make? What do we have a hunch about?\nLet us consider the Short Term Memory(STM) of Foundation Students at SMI as our vehicle for testing similar Hypotheses.2\n\nSTM scores are significantly different between students of Design and those of Art (;-O)\nSTM is much better for those who use Windows as compared to those who use Macs\nAny other factors, not related to types of individuals, but more like parameters of STM itself, also affect the STM scores, for example:\n\nWord complexity (Syllables per Word)\nNo of Words\nExposure Time and Recall Time\n\n\n\nWith the Guilford Divergent Thinking Test, you might consider:\n\nStudents who speak their Mother Tongue fluently score better in Divergent Thinking Scores (Fluency, Flexibility, Elaboration, Originality)\nThere is a significant difference in Guilford Scores between students from ‚Äúsmall towns‚Äù and those from metros.\nFactors in Hypothesis\nIn each of these Hypotheses, we can see that there are binary (Yes/No) (two-valued) parameters that are part of the test: Art vs Design, Windows vs Mac, Speaks Mother Tongue or Not, Small Town vs Metro, Long vs Short List of Words, Short vs Long Words and Long vs Short Exposure.\nIf we want our experiment to be fair we must have:\n\nDevise a test tool for each combination of binary parameters (Test Type)\nthe same number of subjects for each Test Type\n\nrandomly select the people as respondents each Test Type\n\nWe will choose one of these questions, or a similar one, and use the PPDAC Method to proceed with our Experiment. This paper by Lawrence to guide our Hypothesis Testing and the Design of our Experiment:\nLawrence - A Design of Experiments Workshop as an Introduction to Statistics - PDF).\nThis is the paper describing a simple Design of Experiments workshop in class much like ours. We will try to mimic as much of this as we can. Do read through this in the evening today in preparation for our experiment.\nData Analysis-1: Comparison of STM Histograms using Excel and WTFcsv\nOnce our test/survey is complete, let us collate all the data for all tests using this Excel spreadsheet, which we can place on Google Drive for the whole class. (This is for the STM Hypothesis; we can adapt this spreadsheet for any other hypothesis test with categorical factors andscores.)\n\nEnter the data from all tests on the first sheet titled ‚ÄúRawData‚Äù (the one with the warning)\nDownload and save as your own named local copy.\n\nDuplicate this data on the sheet titled ‚ÄúData Duplicated‚Äù. Do not touch the ‚ÄúRawData‚Äù sheet again. Good Practice to not touch original data!!\nFor each of the factors under consideration, we will need to stack up STM scores from \\(2^3 = 8\\) tests, i.e.¬†eight columns.\nIf we have three two-valued, categorical factors, we will get three sets of stacked scores, each from a (shuffled) set of the tests.\nHalf the scores in these stacked columns will pertain to one level of the factor, and the other half of the scores will pertain to the other level. (This should remind you of the Karnaugh Map you may have learnt in your digital logic courses in school.). See example below: it shows how we can stack up the scores from 4 tests for each level of the parameter p1.\n\n\n\n\n\nscores\ntest\np1\np2\np3\n\n\n\n20\nA\nTrue\nLong\nBig\n\n\n20\nB\nTrue\nLong\nSmall\n\n\n20\nC\nTrue\nShort\nBig\n\n\n20\nD\nTrue\nShort\nSmall\n\n\n20\nE\nFalse\nLong\nBig\n\n\n20\nF\nFalse\nLong\nSmall\n\n\n20\nG\nFalse\nShort\nBig\n\n\n20\nH\nFalse\nShort\nSmall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will set up each of these two stacked-score columns in Col A on separate sheets, similar to the one shown in the sheet titled ‚ÄúPermutation Test‚Äù. One sheet for each two-valued parameter.\nCreate paired Histograms for each of the two stacked-score columns using WTFcsv, or Excel itself if you are confident. Ensure that there are TWO Histograms: one for each value of the factor under consideration.\nInspection of the shapes and locations of these paired Histograms may give you an idea whether the factor under consideration has any effect on STM scores or none.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave these 6 histograms as PNG files on your machines and use them along with Comic Generator (discussed below) to tell the story of your Hypothesis Testing.\nComputing Parallel Worlds: The Permutation Test\nBTW, why did Gabbar Singh say to Kaalia and the others in Sholay, ‚ÄúHum ko kuchh nahi pata‚Äù? And then afterwards, ‚ÄúKamal ho gaya‚Äù‚Ä¶why does he say that?\nWhat if we cannot trust our eyes to compare the pair-wise Histograms? If there was considerable overlap? Is there a better way? Can we fix this by playing another Childhood Game? Yes, with a deck of cards! But before we play with cards, some background:\n\nFrom: Gabbar Singh Tim C. Hesterberg (2015) What Teachers Should Know About the Bootstrap: Resampling in the Undergraduate Statistics Curriculum, The American Statistician, 69:4, 371-386 DOI: 10.1080/00031305.2015.1089789\n\n\nStudent B. R. was annoyed by TV commercials. He suspected that there were more commercials in the ‚Äúbasic‚Äù TV channels, the ones that come with a cable TV subscription, than in the ‚Äúextended‚Äù channels you pay extra for. To check this, he collected the data shown in Table 1. He measured an average of 9.21 minutes of commercials per half hour in the basic channels, vs only 6.87 minutes in the extended channels. This seems to support his hypothesis. But there is not much data‚Äîperhaps the difference was just random. The poor guy could only stand to watch 20 random half hours of TV. Actually, he didn‚Äôt even do that‚Äîhe got his girlfriend to watch half of it. (Are you as appalled by the deluge of commercials as I am? This is per half-hour!)\n\n\n\n\n\nbasic\nextended\n\n\n\n6.950\n3.383\n\n\n10.013\n7.800\n\n\n10.620\n9.416\n\n\n10.150\n4.660\n\n\n8.583\n5.360\n\n\n7.620\n7.630\n\n\n8.233\n4.950\n\n\n10.350\n8.013\n\n\n11.016\n7.800\n\n\n8.516\n9.580\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 2.3459\n\n\n\nThe average difference in ad times between the two sets of TV channels is 2.34.\n\n\nHow easy would it be for a difference of 2.34 minutes to occur just by chance? To answer this, we suppose there really is no difference between the two groups, that ‚Äúbasic‚Äù and ‚Äúextended‚Äù are just labels. So what would happen if we assign labels randomly? How often would a difference like 2.34 occur?\nWe‚Äôll pool all twenty observations, randomly pick 10 of them to label ‚Äúbasic‚Äù and label the rest ‚Äúextended‚Äù, and compute the difference in means between the two groups. We‚Äôll repeat that many times, say ten thousand, to get the permutation distribution shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nchannel\ntimes\n\n\n\nbasic\n6.950\n\n\nextended\n3.383\n\n\nbasic\n10.013\n\n\nextended\n7.800\n\n\nbasic\n10.620\n\n\nextended\n9.416\n\n\nbasic\n10.150\n\n\nextended\n4.660\n\n\nbasic\n8.583\n\n\nextended\n5.360\n\n\nbasic\n7.620\n\n\nextended\n7.630\n\n\nbasic\n8.233\n\n\nextended\n4.950\n\n\nbasic\n10.350\n\n\nextended\n8.013\n\n\nbasic\n11.016\n\n\nextended\n7.800\n\n\nbasic\n8.516\n\n\nextended\n9.580\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe observed statistic 2.34 is also shown; the fraction of the distribution to the right of that value (‚â• 2.34) is the probability that random labeling would give a difference that large. In this case, the probability of this value ( area coloured in green ) is &lt; 0.005.\nIt would be rare for a difference this large to occur by chance. We have randomly tried ‚Äúall possible chances‚Äù and are hardly able to achieve similar, and the rarer something is, the more likely that there is an underlying truth.\nAnd therefore we conclude there is a real difference between the groups and that ad time is different between basic and extended TV channels.\n\nData Analysis-2: Creating Parallel Worlds\n\nWe will execute on Permutation Test on one sheet step by step and decide whether that factor had a significant effect on STM scores.\nWe pretend that there is no difference in scores whether the factor is chosen on way or another.\nWe mechanize this pretence by lumping ‚Äúboth kinds‚Äù of scores together and shuffle them and divide them, randomly into two groups, and take the difference in scores.\nWe can do this, like we did with our Monte Carlo experiment, many many times and calculate difference in scores each time. (It is like inventing many parallel worlds)\nIf we look at the way these randomly computed scores are distributed and compare with the one measurement we did see, we can decide whether Mother Nature is up to something, or we are able to mimic the Mom.\nIf we are not able to mimic Mom, then Mom always knows and we bow to her and ascribe a significance to the factor under consideration. Else, nope.\nReplicate this test for the other (binary) factors.\n\nApropos: how could we do this for non-binary factors ‚Ä¶??!!!\nMaking a Data Comic out of our Experiment\nWhat have been our Conclusions with the Experiment?
